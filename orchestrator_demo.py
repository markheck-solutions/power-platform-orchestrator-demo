**Generated**: {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}
**Classification**: Enterprise Business Application

## Executive Summary

This document provides IT governance information for deploying and managing the
Expense Approval System in accordance with enterprise security, compliance, and
operational standards.

## Security Framework

### Access Control
- **Role-Based Security**: Three-tier access model
  - Expense Admin: Full system administration (Organization scope)
  - Expense Approver: Approval authority with audit trail (Business Unit scope)
  - Expense Submitter: Submit and track own requests (User scope)

### Authentication
- **Production**: Azure AD integration with conditional access policies
- **Service Accounts**: Managed identities for automated processes
- **MFA**: Required for approver roles

### Data Security
- Field-level security on sensitive financial data
- Audit logging enabled on all transactions
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Data retention: 7 years (configurable per compliance requirements)

## Compliance & Governance

### Regulatory Considerations
- SOX compliance for financial controls
- GDPR considerations for employee data
- Internal audit trail requirements
- Segregation of duties enforcement

### Financial Controls
- Approval thresholds configurable by role
- Automated policy violation detection
- Budget constraint validation
- Cost center allocation tracking

### Audit & Monitoring
- Complete approval history with timestamps
- Policy exception reporting
- User activity logging
- Automated compliance reporting

## Licensing Requirements

### Base Requirements
- **Power Apps**: Per-user license recommended for approvers
- **Dataverse**: Included with Power Apps license
- **Power Automate**: Per-user for approval workflows

### Cost Projections
- Base deployment: $20/user/month (approvers and admins)
- Submitter-only users: $5/user/app/month option available
- Estimated total: [Calculate based on user counts]

### Optional Enhancements
- Power BI Premium: Executive dashboards ($20/user/month)
- Premium connectors: If integrating with external systems

## Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)

### Environment Strategy
1. **Development**: Unmanaged solution for configuration
2. **Test/QA**: Managed solution import with test data
3. **Production**: Managed solution with change control process

### Deployment Process
- Solution packaged as managed application
- Environment variables for environment-specific configuration
- Connection references for portable deployment
- Automated deployment via Azure DevOps pipelines (enterprise version)

### Change Management
- Version control in Git repository
- Peer review process for changes
- Automated testing framework (enterprise version)
- Rollback procedures documented

## Integration Security

### Authentication Methods
**Production (Recommended)**:
- Service principal with least-privilege permissions
- Certificate-based authentication
- Managed identities where applicable

**Development/Test**:
- Per-user authentication acceptable
- Switch to service principal before production

### Data Integration
- Connection references for all external systems
- API rate limiting and throttling management
- Error handling and retry logic
- Integration monitoring and alerting

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Data breach | Low | High | Encryption, RBAC, audit logging |
| System downtime | Low | Medium | High availability configuration |
| Approval delays | Medium | Medium | SLA monitoring, escalation rules |
| Policy violations | Medium | High | Automated validation, alerts |

### Business Risks
- **User Adoption**: Training program required
- **Process Change**: Change management plan needed
- **Data Quality**: Data validation rules implemented

## Monitoring & Support

### Performance Monitoring
- Application Insights integration
- API call volume tracking
- User activity metrics
- Approval cycle time analytics

### Support Model
- Tier 1: End user support (submission issues)
- Tier 2: Approver support (workflow questions)
- Tier 3: Technical support (system administration)

### Incident Response
- Critical: Approval workflow failure (< 1 hour response)
- High: Performance degradation (< 4 hours)
- Medium: Feature issues (< 1 business day)
- Low: Enhancement requests (planned releases)

## Deployment Checklist

Before production deployment:

- [ ] Security roles configured and tested
- [ ] Approval thresholds set per policy
- [ ] Integration testing completed
- [ ] User training delivered
- [ ] Support model established
- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Backup and recovery tested
- [ ] Compliance review approved
- [ ] Executive sponsor signoff obtained

## Enterprise Version Capabilities

This demonstration includes foundational governance framework.

**Enterprise version includes**:
- Industry-specific compliance templates (Healthcare, Financial Services, etc.)
- Advanced threat modeling and security assessments
- Automated compliance reporting and dashboards
- Integration with enterprise GRC platforms
- Custom policy engine configuration
- Advanced audit trail analysis

- Disaster recovery planning

## Version History

| Version | Date | Changes | Approver |
|---------|------|---------|----------|
| 1.0.0   | {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')} | Initial deployment | [Pending] |
