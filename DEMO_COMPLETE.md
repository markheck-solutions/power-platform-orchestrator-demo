### 2. LinkedIn/Resume Update

**Talking Point**:
```
Power Platform Solutions Orchestrator - Enterprise automation system
that generates production-ready Model-Driven applications with
comprehensive governance frameworks.

• Conversational requirements gathering using design thinking
• Automated governance documentation (security, compliance, ALM)
• Model-Driven Apps with Custom Pages (100% programmable)
• Multi-pattern architecture (5+ solution types)

Demo: github.com/markheck-solutions/orchestrator-demo
Tech: Python, React, Power Platform, Microsoft APIs
```

### 3. Interview Preparation

**Opening Statement**:
"I developed an enterprise Power Platform solution generation system
that automates the creation of governed, production-ready applications.
The demo shows one pattern to prove the technical approach, while the
full enterprise version includes multiple patterns and advanced features."

**Discussion Topics**:
- Why governance-first? (reduces risk, accelerates deployment)
- Why Model-Driven? (100% programmable vs 80% GUI)
- Why conversational? (better requirements than forms)
- Why patterns? (reusability, consistency, best practices)
- Architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Enterprise deployment considerations

**Differentiation**:
"Most developers show code samples. I built a complete system that
generates enterprise-grade solutions. This demonstrates not just coding
ability, but systems thinking, enterprise awareness, and innovation."
